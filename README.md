## Hi there, I'm Scott! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an undergraduate computer engineering student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who does a fair amount of coding and playing around with Arudinos. Currently learning how to build solar electricity grids, how to use PHP and MySQL within a LAMP stack, and how to use React, Tailwind CSS, and more through Next.JS. Always looking to learn new things about programming, engineering, or music playing.
